Haskell bindings for the Yelp v2.0 API
======================================

This package exports bindings to the [Yelp v2.0 API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview). The architecture was heavily inspired by the [fb](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fb) package.

**Note that this package is purely experimental at this point. Is has not been tested and the interface will most likely change.** That's also the reason why it's not on Hackage yet.
